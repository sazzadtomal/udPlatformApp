//How to run this file!


As per my knowledge, we cannot modify a file inside of an executable jar file.

In this project, I have used a (.txt) file to store data.


For that reason, to run this code, you need an ide called IntelliJ IDEA.

To run this project,

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Get from VCS
3. In the URL Section, Paste the this link- "https://github.com/sazzadtomal/udPlatformApp"
4. Then Build the project.
5. Locate to Main folder situated in src folder in Project Sidebar.
6. Hit run.


I hope you will like this project.

Thank you.
