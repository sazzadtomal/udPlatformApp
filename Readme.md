How to run this file!


In this project, I have used a (.txt) file as data storage.
Jar files restricts data storage to an external file. 

For that reason, to run this code, you need an ide called "IntelliJ IDEA".

To run this project,

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click-> Get from VCS
3. In the URL Section, Paste the this link-"https://github.com/sazzadtomal/udPlatformApp"
4. Build the project.
5. Locate to Main file situated in src folder in Project Sidebar.
6. Hit run.


For testing-

1. Locate to test folder in src directory.
2. Select a Test.  (example- "FileOperationTest")
3. Hit run.



I hope you will like this project.

Thank you.
